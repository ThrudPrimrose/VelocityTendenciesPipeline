"""Velocity-tendencies stage-4 GPU offload.

Takes a stage-3 SDFG (all map schedules ``Default``, transients at the
root SDFG with ``AllocationLifetime.SDFG``, mixed storage) and produces
a GPU-compilable SDFG by doing three things in a specific order:

1. **Assign schedules** (must be first so the pass can distinguish
   kernel-side from host-side nodes). Top-level ``MapEntry`` /
   ``LibraryNode`` → ``GPU_Device``; top-level ``NestedSDFG`` →
   ``GPU_Default``; everything below a top-level scope →
   ``Sequential``.
2. **Mirror every non-transient top-level Array to a ``gpu_<name>``
   sibling on GPU_Global** — but only if any AccessNode for that array
   sits inside a kernel scope or at the kernel boundary (i.e. wired to
   a MapEntry/MapExit/NestedSDFG). Pure host-side arrays (only touched
   by top-level Tasklets) are left alone. A single copy-in state is
   added as the new start, a single copy-out state as the new terminal.
   Kernel-side AccessNodes and their memlets are retargeted to the
   ``gpu_`` variant; host-side ones keep the original name.
3. **Promote every transient Array to ``GPU_Global``** (storage only;
   shape/strides are whatever stage 3 established).

After all three, validate **and** sanity-check that no GPU-scheduled
kernel writes its output into a scalar (DaCe's CUDA codegen rejects
that; fail loudly here rather than at codegen time).

Distilled from ``ToGPU`` (dace@f2dace/staging,
``dace/transformation/passes/to_gpu.py``, 911 lines). The original
interleaves these phases, has a dead ``get_const_arrays`` branch, uses
``is_devicelevel_gpu`` on a mixed-state SDFG which causes races between
schedule assignment and memlet retargeting, and carries
``cpu_library_nodes`` / ``exclude`` knobs that velocity doesn't use.
Here each phase is explicit and the kernel/host split is resolved
structurally from the stage-3 topology.
